The Employee Management System (EMS) is a C++ console application designed to streamline employee management in an organization. It allows administrators to add, update, and manage both full-time and part-time employee profiles, assign departments, track attendance and performance, calculate salary packages, and generate detailed reports. Employees can log in to view their profiles and receive performance assessments. Admins can also mark attendance, assign performance ratings, and manage departments. The system provides clear differentiation between roles and supports essential HR functionalities, making it a useful tool for small to medium-sized organizations.
